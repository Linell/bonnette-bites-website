  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1 Egg
    * 1/2 Tablespoon Mustard
    * 2 Tablespoons Lemon Juice (about one whole lemon's worth of juice)
    * 1 Teaspoon Sugar
    * 1 Teaspoon Salt
    * 1 Teaspoon Pepper
    * 1 Cup Canola Oil

    1. Add the egg, mustard, sugar, and lemon juice into the jar that came with
    your immersion blender. Add salt and pepper to taste.

    2. Pour the oil on top of the other ingredients.

    3. Place the immersion blender to the bottom of the jar. Turn it on and keep
    it to the bottom of the jar until you see the emulsification starting. This
    doesn't take very long at all – somewhere in the range of ten to fifteen
    seconds.

    4. Slowly start moving the immersion blender up and down inside of the jar
    to help fully combine the ingredients.

    5. Once everything is homogenous, remove the blender and scoop it out into a
    jar for storing in the fridge.

    The mayo will last for about a week in the refrigerator.&nbsp;

Mayonnaise has grown to be my favorite condiment, and I can say that with confidence. I love a good hot sauce, ketchup is a staple in my fridge, and I can't imagine not having mustard in my life, but you just can't be the&nbsp;*versatility*&nbsp;of mayo. This quick, easy recipe for homemade mayo is a game changer.

&nbsp;

Spread it on a hamburger. Make it into an aioli and put it on your hamburger. The variety of dipping sauces you can create is endless, there's nothing better than a good dipping sauce for french fries when you're enjoying a great hamburger. Like I say, the uses for a good mayo are nearly limitless.

Until recently, I thought all mayo was created equal. I'm a sucker for advertising so I've tried them all. The promises of how one was better than the other always just fell short – mayonnaise was, after all, just mayonnaise. That changed when I got curious about what Guy Fieri's "Donkey Sauce" tastes like and came across [this recipe](https://www.macheesmo.com/homemade-donkey-sauce/), which said:

> Can you use store-bought mayo? Absolutely\! But to get the true flavor town experience it’s nice to try homemade\!

A few days later, Jonna and I decided we wanted to see what all the hubbub was about. We found [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDWwulklcnI) and gave it a shot and, to put it mildly, the hubbub was well deserved. It's not like I'm never going to buy store bought mayo again, because it's already on our grocery list, but given how easy this is to make, it's&nbsp;*definitely*&nbsp;going to become a regular addition to our meals.
