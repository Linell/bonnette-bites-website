    * 1 Egg
    * 1/2 Tablespoon Mustard
    * 2 Tablespoons Lemon Juice (about one whole lemon's worth of juice)
    * 1 Cup Canola Oil
    * Salt
    * Pepper

    1. Add the egg, mustard, and lemon juice into the jar that came with your
    immersion blender. Add salt and pepper to taste.

    2. Pour the oil on top of the other ingredients.

    3. Place the immersion blender to the bottom of the jar. Turn it on and keep
    it to the bottom of the jar until you see the emulsification starting. This
    doesn't take very long at all -- somewhere in the range of ten to fifteen
    seconds.

    4. Slowly start moving the immersion blender up and down inside of the jar
    to help fully combine the ingredients.

    5. Once everything is homogenous, remove the blender and scoop it out into a
    jar for storing in the fridge.

    The mayo will last for about a week in the refrigerator.&nbsp;
