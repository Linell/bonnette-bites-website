Sunday morning brunch is a Bonnette household tradition. We sleep as late as we can, or as late as the dogs will let us, and lie in bed until we just can't stand it anymore. We get up, brew a big pot of coffee, and start playing around with cooking something fun. The food itself varies a lot depending on what groceries we've got leftover from the week's meals, but a fried egg is a staple of pretty much every week.

That's, of course, not to say that fried eggs can only be for breakfast or brunch\! The truth is that there's not an hour in the day that a good fried egg&nbsp;*isn't*&nbsp;going to hit the spot. You know I've got a weak spot for hamburgers, and if you've never tried that combination I can't recommend it enough, but they're great with just about anything that could use little dose of delicious fat ooey-gooey goodness. If you've got any recommendations, please leave them in the comments below\! The long and the short of it is that knowing hot to really nail a fried egg is an easy way to up your culinary game all day long.

Fried eggs haven't always gone so smoothly for me. I found getting them right consistently much harder than I would have expected, given that Waffle House seems to get them right all day every day. Mine would come out undercooked, overcooked, gummy, or just not very tasty more often than not, if I'm being honest. It was pretty frustrating really -- having a delicious meal cooked and then topping it with a very meh egg.

The first step in my egg frying journey was realizing that I needed

Finding this method of making eggs was a game changer. Admittedly, it's nothing all that crazy. If you look on the [Ask Culinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/){: target="_blank"} or [Cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/){: target="_blank"} subreddits, the consensus is always just "add more butter". Turns out they've been right this whole time and I just wasn't adding enough all along\!

It&nbsp;*is*&nbsp;worth noting that you can absolutely add too much butter. It'll result in the eggs sliding around the pan too much and being hard to keep together for that perfect fried egg shape. It's not the worst thing in the world, but it&nbsp;*does*&nbsp;make your life a little harder.
