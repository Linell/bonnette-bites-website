    1. Melt the butter in either a nonstick or a cast iron skillet over medium
    heat. A 10" is the perfect size for two eggs.

    2. When the butter gets foamy, add in the two eggs. I like to crack them
    into a little bowl with a spout so that they're easier to pour neatly, which
    leads to a nicer shape.

    3. As the eggs cook, tilt the pan so that the butter pools in the bottom and
    use a spoon to baste the hot butter over the eggs. Baste mostly the whites,
    but you can hit the yolks too if you'd like them to be more firm.

    4. Baste the eggs until all of the egg white is set -- about two to three
    minutes.&nbsp;

    5. Transfer the eggs to a plate and season with salt and pepper.

    6. Keep the pan, now just full of butter, over medium heat. Cook the butter
    until it's golden, just a couple more minutes.

    7. Pour the butter over the eggs. Trust me.

Sunday morning brunch is a Bonnette household tradition. We sleep as late as we can, or as late as the dogs will let us, and lie in bed until we just can't stand it anymore. We get up, brew a big pot of coffee, and start playing around with cooking something fun. The food itself varies a lot depending on what groceries we've got leftover from the week's meals, but a fried egg is a staple of pretty much every week.

That's, of course, not to say that fried eggs can only be for breakfast or brunch\! The truth is that there's not an hour in the day that a good fried egg&nbsp;*isn't*&nbsp;going to hit the spot. You know I've got a weak spot for hamburgers, and if you've never tried that combination I can't recommend it enough, but they're great with just about anything that could use little dose of delicious fat ooey-gooey goodness. If you've got any recommendations, please leave them in the comments below\! The long and the short of it is that knowing hot to really nail a fried egg is an easy way to up your culinary game all day long.

Fried eggs haven't always gone so smoothly for me. I found getting them right consistently much harder than I would have expected, given that Waffle House seems to get them right all day every day. Mine would come out undercooked, overcooked, gummy, or just not very tasty more often than not, if I'm being honest. It was pretty frustrating really -- having a delicious meal cooked and then topping it with a very meh egg.

The first step in my egg frying journey was realizing that I needed more butter. If you look on the [Ask Culinary](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/){: target="_blank"} or [Cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/){: target="_blank"} subreddits, the consensus is always just "add more butter". Turns out they've been right this whole time. The second, and I'd argue bigger differentiator, was that I needed to actually baste the eggs in the butter. This helps the tops of the eggs cook through before the bottom ends up overcooked and gummy. It makes it easy for me to adjust how I want the yolk too, by basting it if I want it more set or only basting the whites if I want it nice and runny. The changes are super simple, but I haven't made a single egg I didn't enjoy since implementing them.

It&nbsp;*is*&nbsp;worth noting that you can absolutely add too much butter. It'll result in the eggs sliding around the pan too much and being hard to keep together for that perfect fried egg shape. That's actually why the eggs are so close together in the picture above. It's not the worst thing in the world, but it&nbsp;*does*&nbsp;make your life a little harder.

It's also good to think about the flavors you're adding via basting, because while just butter itself is going to be great, you&nbsp;*can*&nbsp;get a little wild and [make flavored butters for the basting](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/basting-fried-eggs-flavored-butters){: target="_blank"} and impart different flavors.

Anyway, here's the recipe in all of its glorious simplicity\!
