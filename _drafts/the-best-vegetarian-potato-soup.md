As we transition from summer into fall, soups become a major part of our dinner rotation. We love a delicious white bean soup, chili, or taco soup, but I have been missing out on that creamy, cheesy, bacon-y goodness of potato soup. Of course, most recipes call for chicken broth and bacon and we're plant based around here, so I had to come up with a recipe that fit our lifestyle without sacrificing taste or that perfect "ahhh" feeling you get with a warm bowl of soup.

I looooooove using tempeh as a bacon substitute and you can find our perfect recipe [here](/protein/2020/05/20/crispy-oven-baked-tempeh-bacon/). Just a heads up\! You're going to want to make a batch of "bacon" before you get started with this soup recipe (and it's perfect because you'll have a few pieces leftover for a nice breakfast).

We hope to have a few other soup recipes up before the end of the year. Let us know your favorite recipes below\!&nbsp;
