    * 2-3 tbps olive oil
    * 2 heads of garlic
  directions_markdown: >-
    * Preheat your oven to 400&deg;

    * Rub most of the paper skin off your garlic heads, without separating or
    exposing the actual cloves.

    * Cut the tops of your garlic heads off, exposing the little "tunnel" inside
    of each clove.

    * In a small baking dish, lay down enough tin foil to create a loose
    "package" around your garlic heads.

    * Place your garlic heads in the foil, and drizzle 1 tbps of olive oil on
    top of the cloves, and repeat until the oil absorbs and you can see it
    pooling beneath the garlic heads, about 2 more tbps.

    * Wrap the foil loosely around the heads. It's important not to let the foil
    touch the tops, as the garlic could get stuck to it while roasting,
    resulting in a smaller yield.

    * Roast for at least an hour, but as long as an hour and a half. Remove from
    the oven, and open your packet up to let the garlic breathe. (*Optional*\:
    *Place garlic back in the oven uncovered and roast for an additional 5
    minutes until some crispy bits have formed. It's textural and adds a
    slightly charred flavor)&nbsp;*

    * Let garlic cool.

    * After they're cooled, grab a small bowl and squeeze (think of how you
    would get toothpaste out of a tube) each clove until your all of your cloves
    are empty.&nbsp;

    * Mash the garlic, and add to your favorite crema, aioli, or really
    anything\!

Roasted garlic is....in a word, everything. It's a coveted ingredient in my house and we add it to anything we can think of that needs a little extra oomph. It's delicious in aiolis, cremas, butter, seasoned olive oil, soups, sandwich spreads, pasta dishes - okay, so as I'm typing this out I guess it'd be easier to say that it's delicious in literally anything that can take on the flavor of garlic.&nbsp;

Roasted garlic is&nbsp;*very*&nbsp;forgiving, which is perfect for novice cooks looking to step up their game. You can cook it for a pretty long time, but I've found that an hour and fifteen minutes is sort of the sweet spot for our oven. Of course if you want to roast it on a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time, you can, but beware that it could result in some of your cloves burning on the outside. This results in a hard, blackened clove that are no good to eat, unless burned food is your speciality. We don't judge in this household.

Taking the paper skin off garlic can be a pain in the ass. One wrong move and you've got cloves breaking off left and right, so I try not to stress about getting every single piece off. Cutting the tops off is actually my favorite part of the entire process because you get to see down into the garlic and where the oil absorbs. My favorite knife to use for cutting the tops off the garlic is definitely a small paring knife, like this [Cuisinart knife](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-C77SS-3PR-Graphix-Collection-Stainless/dp/B01DUT41M0/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=cuisinart+stainless+paring+knife&amp;qid=1589306189&amp;s=home-garden&amp;sr=1-2){: target="_blank"}.

Once you pull the garlic out of the oven after its initial roast, you can leave it be. You do&nbsp;*not*&nbsp;have to put it back in the oven for an additional 5 minutes. If you choose not to roast any additional time, it should look like this:

Man, I could drink the olive oil in the bottom of that foil packet. I won't, but I could.

I really like the little crispy, charred bits that form on the edges of the cloves from that exposed roasting time. Mine tends to look like this when I'm done with the initial roast and the exposed roast:

It's a sticky job to squeeze the gooey, delicious cloves out of their skin. You can take the back of your paring knife and "toothpaste roll" them out, but when I tried that I ended up with skin in my roasted garlic. So, I prefer to use my hands. You can dip your fingers in a little bit of water to help it not stick or spray your fingers with non-stick cooking spray.&nbsp;

Mashing your garlic once it cools it definitely optional, but to me it's the easiest way to not have to do work later down the road if I'm adding it to a sauce or a soup. You can store roasted garlic in a jar for about a week, but I promise it won't make it the full week. Once you start cooking with it, you aren't going to want to stop. Ever.
