    * Using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, mix the dry seitan
    ingredients (wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, spices) together on low until
    combined.

    * In a separate bowl, mix the wet seitan cutlet ingredients together. Whisk
    until combined.

    * With your mixer on medium low, pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Once
    combined, turn your mixer on medium speed and mix for 3-4 minutes. Your
    dough will be sticky, but still pull from the sides of the bowl.&nbsp;

    * Turn your dough out onto a cutting board and form into a disc. Cut into
    four equal pieces.&nbsp;

    * Using your hands, shape the cutlets and thin them out until they're about
    1/2" thick. Wrap them loosely in tin foil packets, leaving room to grow
    slightly.

    * Bring a pot of water to a simmer, and then place your wrapped cutlets into
    a steamer pot (or metal colander lined with foil around the sides) and
    cover.

    * Steam for 35-40 minutes until firm. Unwrap and let cool. Fry immediately
    or store in a freezer bag for up to three days.


    For Frying:


    * Heat your oil (32 oz in a large cast iron works for us) in a deep cast
    iron pan until it reaches 325&deg;.

    * In the meantime, mix the egg and milk together in one shallow dish and the
    dry batter ingredients into another.

    * Dip the cutlets into the dry ingredients first, then the wet, then the dry
    again. Rest on a cooling rack until you're ready to cook them.

    * Once the oil has heated to 325&deg;, place your cutlets in and fry for
    four minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Place them on a
    paper towel lined plate or a raised rack.

    * Season with additional salt and pepper and serve immediately\!&nbsp;

I love good, Southern food. Fried chicken, creamy mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, etc...you name it, I love it. To me, seitan is the holy grail of vegetarian comfort food and I love our recipe for Chicken Fried Seitan\!&nbsp;

When I made seitan for the first time, I kept thinking, 'Is this supposed to look like a blob of chewing gum?' YES\! As long as it pulls from the side and doesn't feel too dry, your seitan will be delicious as long as you season it correctly\!

I like to use a pastry cutter for seitan because it is very dough-like. The serving size actually comes out to a 4oz portion and would be perfect alone or on a fried "chicken" sandwich.

To wrap the seitan cutlet most effectively, I like to cut the foil to be about twice the size of the cutlet. I fold the ends that can't cover the seitan completely first, then the pieces that can. I wrap it tightly enough that the seitan can't peak out, but loose enough to let it expand while cooking.

It's okay to stack them\! Our steamer pot is very tiny and only holds four seitan patties at a time, and I've never had an issue with stacking.

Aren't they so delicious looking after frying?\! One of our favorite things to do is save our leftovers cutlets and use them on biscuits with honey butter the next morning. SO GOOD\!
