    * 7 tbsp unsalted butter, divided
    * 12 oz crawfish tails (fresh or frozen, just thaw them out)
    * 1 yellow onion, finely diced
    * 1 green bell pepper, finely diced
    * 2-3 stalks of celery, finely diced
    * 3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
    * 1 large tomato, finely diced (seeds and pulp removed)
    * 1/2 cup green onions, finely chopped
    * 1/2 cup all purpose flour
    * 1 tbsp tomato paste
    * 4 cups seafood stock (or crawfish stock if you made your own)
    * 3 tsp Worcestershire sauce
    * 1-2 tsp hot sauce, depending your spice level preference
    * 2 tsp cajun seasoning (we use Tony's)
    * 1/2 tsp kosher salt
    * 1/4 tsp black pepper
    * 1 bay leaf
    * Juice from half a lemon
  directions_markdown: >-
    * In a large pan (large, y'all) over medium-high heat, add 6 tbsp butter
    until it's just melted.

    * When butter is just melted, add onion, bell pepper, and celery. Sauté
    until softened, about 5-8 minutes.

    * Add the garlic and sauté for an additional minute.

    * Sprinkle the all purpose flour over the mixture and stir until a thick
    paste forms, about 1-2 minutes.

    * Stir in tomato paste and then slowly add half of the broth. Stir until
    well combined and add the remaining broth.

    * Stir in Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, cajun seasoning, salt, pepper,
    bay leaf, and diced tomato.

    * When a simmer is maintained, reduce heat to low and cook for 30-45 minutes
    until your desired consistency has been reached. (It should not be runny at
    all. Think of a thick gravy.)

    * Stir in crawfish tails, remaining tbsp of butter, lemon juice, and half of
    the green onions. Cook for five minutes.

    * Remove from heat and serve over white rice. Garnish with remaining green
    onions.

I have spent years perfecting my crawfish étouffée recipe. We only get it a few weeks out of the year, so you have to make a lot of it while it's around\! This recipe is great because it's got heat without being overbearing. It's got fantastic flavor from the stock and I&nbsp;*highly*&nbsp;recommend you make your own crawfish stock if you can. All you have to do is fill a stock pot about half full with water and add some leftover crawfish heads and claws, two onions, four carrots, a few stalks of celery, a few cloves of garlic, and fresh thyme in a pot and let it simmer for about an hour. Strain it and you're good to go\!

This recipe has made everyone who has tried to a happy camper. It's honestly a mashup of a million recipes combined with my own personal adjustments and taste.&nbsp;
