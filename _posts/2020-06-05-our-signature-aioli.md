I feel like the one thing everyone in the world has in common is a love for a good signature sauce. There's a running joke between us that I always make way,&nbsp;**way too much**&nbsp;of whatever sauce I'm making. I can't make a small enough amount. It's a love affair, and I think I've finally found my Mr. Right (or Mrs. - we don't judge here). A spicy, tangy garlicky aioli that goes perfectly on fries, burgers, chicken strips, or honestly anything else you could slather in sauce. The key is perfectly roasted garlic and you can find our recipe [here](https://bonnettebites.com/condiments/2020/05/12/roasted-garlic/){: target="_blank"}\!&nbsp;

It's literally wham, bam, thank you ma'am after you roast your garlic. You can adjust any of these measurements to fit your taste, especially the hot sauce. We like ours a little spicier than what we called for here, but I wanted to cater to the masses who don't like fire shooting out of their asses. (*poetry)*

Any combination of fat, heat, salt, and acid works. Avocado, lime juice, Tajin, and jalapeno hot sauce makes a BOMB Mexican dipping sauce (thin it out with more lime juice for dipping consistency). Mayonnaise, korean BBQ sauce, lime, and ginger are a perfect dip for stir-fried veggies. Our final product is a smooth, tangy, and spicy sauce that well....we friggin' love. We recommend making this sauce at least four hours before you want to serve it so the ingredients can meld together, have a few drinks, and become friends.
