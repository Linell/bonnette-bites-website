\*exhales deep breath\* We hate leftovers. Like…if I were in a room with leftovers, Hitler, and Bin Laden, I'd shoot leftovers twice. (If you don't watch&nbsp;*The Office*, we still like you and we want you to be our friend.) So anyway, the thought of leftovers makes me want to die is what I'm getting at. Every once in a while, though, a dish will sneak its way into your life and change that sentiment. This is one of those dishes.

I present to you: the red lentil. It's beautiful, nutrient dense, and the star of our Red Lentil Curry Stew.

There's a lot of steps, but this recipe is actually really simple once you get into it. It's all about building flavors and doing things in steps rather than tossing it all in a pot and walking away for an hour.&nbsp;

One thing to remember is that spice builds. So if you put the full 2 tbsp of red pepper flakes into the recipe at the beginning, definitely taste it at the end before adding an entire bottle of red cayenne pepper. Without the cayenne pepper, I would say the spice level on this recipe is a 3.5-4/10, with 1 being a mild jalape&ntilde;o and 10 being a habanero. We like it spicier than most so we actually end up adding an additional tablespoon or so of cayenne when we taste. **Remember:&nbsp;**You can always add spice, but you can't take it away.

The finished product is so pretty. We served it with rice, naan, and then garnished with some greek yogurt (sour cream is fine, too).
