A few weeks ago, I made a BLT using our [tempeh bacon](https://bonnettebites.com/protein/2020/05/20/crispy-oven-baked-tempeh-bacon/){: target="_blank"} recipe and I finished it with a chive cream cheese spread that I've been itching to make again. This week we decided to have breakfast for dinner, which included the coveted buttermilk biscuit. A warm, fluffy, flaky buttermilk biscuit can be eaten by itself just fine, but let's be honest here - it's a biscuit's purpose to be filled with delicious toppings. I wanted the cream cheese spread, but I also love fruity syrups and jams and everything sweet. In true Jonna fashion I said, "f\*ck it, we're doing it live" and this recipe was born. Ooey, gooey, savory, oniony cream cheese topped with a tart and sweet blueberry sauce are officially the best biscuit toppings known to humankind. Trust us.

If you're making these the day of serving, be sure to pull your cream cheese out in time for it to soften before you mix in your chives. You can leave this spread and the blueberry sauce out at room temp for several hours, so feel free to make them in advance\! **You don't want them to be refrigerator cold when you top your biscuits**. You'll be sad, your guests will be sad. Everyone will be sad.

The blueberry sauce is so easy and if you want a chunkier sauce with some whole blueberries left, cook for less time. It's going to reduce a good bit, so don't be intimidated by the amount we called for. If you have leftovers, refrigerated blueberry sauce is delicious on vanilla ice cream or mixed into pancake batter\!
