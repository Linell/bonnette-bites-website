    * Heat 2 tbsp of butter to a large, heavy-bottomed pot on medium. Add diced
    tempeh bacon and cook for 5 minutes until bacon is crispy and dark. Turn
    heat to low and remove bacon. Set aside for serving.

    * Return heat to medium. Add remaining 3 tbsp of butter and onion and cook
    for 4-5 minutes or until translucent and softened.

    * Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds, until noticeably fragrant.

    * Sprinkle flour over ingredients and whisk until smooth. (It will look like
    an onion paste.)

    * Add diced potatoes, veggie broth, milk, heavy cream, salt, pepper, and
    chili powder. Stir well.

    * Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Once boiling, cook soup for about
    ten minutes or until the potatoes are fork tender. Continue to stir
    frequently, but gently, to prevent scorching.

    * Using an immersion blender, blend your soup until about half has processed
    through. If you don't have an immersion blender, remove about five cups of
    your soup and blend in a standing blender until smooth. If you want a less
    chunky soup, blend more\! It's your call.

    * Return the blended soup to the pot. Add sour cream and soy sauce. Simmer
    for 15 minutes.

    * Top with tempeh bacon, cheddar cheese, chives, and sour cream. Serve\!

As we transition from summer into fall, soups become a major part of our dinner rotation. We love a delicious white bean soup, chili, or taco soup, but I have been missing out on that creamy, cheesy, bacon-y goodness of potato soup. Of course, most recipes call for chicken broth and bacon and we're plant based around here, so I had to come up with a recipe that fit our lifestyle without sacrificing taste or that perfect "ahhh" feeling you get with a warm bowl of soup.

I looooooove using tempeh as a bacon substitute and you can find our perfect recipe [here](/protein/2020/05/20/crispy-oven-baked-tempeh-bacon/). Just a heads up\! You're going to want to make a batch of "bacon" before you get started with this soup recipe (and it's perfect because you'll have a few pieces leftover for a nice breakfast).

We hope to have a few other soup recipes up before the end of the year. Let us know your favorite recipes below\!&nbsp;
