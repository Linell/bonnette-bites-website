  ingredients_markdown: >-
    * 1 tbsp olive oil

    * 2 green onions, thinly sliced

    * 4 garlic cloves, minced

    * 1 cup bok choy, rinsed and chopped into 1" pieces

    * 1 carrot, peeled, then shaved into ribbons using the peeler

    * 2 packs of ramen noodles (Any brand is fine\! They just need to be around
    3oz per pack)

    * 2 tbsp sesame seeds for garnish


    For the sauce


    * 2 tbsp coconut aminos (or soy sauce)

    * 1 tsp sesame oil

    * 3 tbsp sweet chili sauce

    * 1 tsp sambal oelek (or 2 if ya frisky)
  directions_markdown: >-
    * Cook ramen noodles as directed (without seasoning), drain, and put them
    back into the pot they were cooked in so they stay warm.

    * Heat oil in a large cast iron or heavy bottomed pan on medium-high heat,
    then add 3/4 of the green onions (we'll use the rest later), and bok choy.
    Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes until the bok choy is tender
    and slightly browned.

    * While the veggies cook down, whisk the sauce together in a small bowl.

    * Add your sauce, noodles, and carrot ribbons to the cooked veggies, mixing
    everything together on medium low heat for 2-3 minutes.

    * Serve topped with the remaining green onions and sesame seeds. You can
    also fry an egg\!&nbsp;

Day 2940 of Quarantine: we're tired, y'all. Everyone is. I feel like menu planning each week has become increasingly difficult because we're eating home pretty much every single night. Easy meals are necessary, especially on days when you're completely uninspired by what's in your pantry - and there's nothing easier than our ramen stir fry\!&nbsp;

This recipe does not include cooking the fried egg pictured, but if you're interested you can always check out our post on how to cook the perfect [fried egg](https://bonnettebites.com/breakfast/eggs/brunch/2020/05/09/sunday-morning-fried-eggs/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}\! I will let you in on a tiny secret. For this recipe, we used olive oil instead of butter to give our egg those perfect, crispy edges.

Lemme tell you about the sauce. 1 tsp of sambal oelek is not spicy to me. At all. 2 tsp of sambal oelek is not very spicy to Linell, but I'm good with it. He said he would use 4 tsp if you are a heat lover; however, Linell is also the guy who literally lost his ability to taste heat a few years ago due to one too many hot wings. So, take your own risk with the sambal oelek\!&nbsp;

This recipe is really easy would honestly be great for meal prepping. It's a great way to pack in (and disguise) vegetables for those picky eaters in your life and it is SO filling, and you don't have to stick with our vegetables at all\! Mushrooms, broccoli, and zucchini would also be delicious in this recipe. Let us know what different veggies you added to yours below\!
